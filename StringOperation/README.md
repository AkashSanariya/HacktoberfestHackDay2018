Example
User input : ABCDEF 
Output : String has all unique charcters

User input : ABCDAD 
Output : String has not all unique charcters

## Find the Dublicate character from String and print it if not having all unique character.

If Dublicate character found multipule time then also print only it one time.

Example 
User input : ABCDDDGHAG 
Output : Dublicate Character found in string are "ADG"

**NOTES
Don't use system define function to perform task
